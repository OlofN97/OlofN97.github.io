							<h2>Detached</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Detached is a Co-op game where players as two robots, Deta and Ched, who have removable  limbs. The limbs can be 
							transferred, thrown and dropped by the players. All players starts with a predetermined amount of limbs on each 
							level and must complete puzzles using the limbs to progress.
						</p>
							<h2>Development</h2>
							<p>
								Detached was a group project between six people. We used an agile methodology with sprints two times a week. The core idea was first for the game
								was agreed upon by all the members. 

								The game design was first drawn on sheets of paper which were used for game testing sessions. After tested, the first prototype was made and 
								game designs documents were written. Using this we started production on the actual game. We divided up areas of the game to each developer.
								My area was networking and UI. My responsibilities included: 
								<ul class="labeled-icons">
									<li>Syncing objects</li>
									<li>Syncing players</li>
									<li>Creating everything realated to the lobby</li>
									<li>Creating the Main menu, settings, etc.</li>
								</ul>
								We used <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/mirror-129321">Mirror</a> as the network library and <a href="https://steamworks.github.io/">Steamworks</a> to be able to use steam to gain access to steams matchmaking.
								My main task was to handle network ownership of the limbs. Since each limb could only belong to one player, each limb was a network object and had a registered owner. If the owner relinquished ownership by dropping or throwing a limb
								then it had no registered owner and was up for grabs by either player.
